			“Time management” refers to the way that you organize and plan how long you spend on specific activities. It may seem counter-intuitive to dedicate precious time to learning about time management, instead of using it to get on with your work, but the benefits are enormous: Greater productivity and efficiency.
			<br>
			The following are a set of useful time management tips:

			<br>
			<ol class="list-ord">

			<li> Realize That Time Management Is a Myth.</li>
			<p>
				This is the first thing you have to understand about time management, that no matter how organized we are, there are always only 24 hours in a day. Time doesn't change. All we can  manage is ourselves and what we do with the time that we have. Appreciate this. Internalize it. And move on as soon as possible to the next tip.
			</p>
				<li>
				Do the most important thing first.
			</li>
			<p>
				 You're less likely to make a good decision at the end of the day than you are at the beginning.<br>
				 If you do the most important thing first, then you’ll never have a day when you didn’t get something important done. By following this simple strategy, you will usually end up having a productive day, even if everything doesn't go to plan. If you do the most important thing first each day, it is the only productivity tip you'll ever need.
			</p>
			<li>Set a time limit to each task.
			</li>
			<p>For instance, reading the news can consume your whole day if you let it. Instead, set a limit of 15 minutes a day for this task and stick to it. The easiest way to do this is to assign a solid block of time to this task rather just remembering to complete the task.</p>
			<li>
				Use a to-do-list, but don’t abandon tasks.
			</li>
			<p>Create to-do lists for each goal and project, listing all the measurable steps that need to be accomplished.<br>Aside from keeping you focused, this also motivates you as you are able to see what you have already achieved, and what remains</p>
			<li>
				Take small breaks frequently.
			</li>
				<p>Smart time management isn’t always about doing something or the other. It also emphasizes on the fact that little breaks after an hour or so can take your productivity to another level.</p>
