# PESU-Student-Support-Platform 
### Hosted at https://ssp.pes.edu/ by the PESU management

## Purpose

tldr; This platform aims to support PES students in non-academic issues by directing them to college counselors and providing them with articles to manage common student issues. 

Mental Health will be an ever growing priority in a university and future batches will be better equiped with skills to make sure the collective purpose of ensuring better reachablity of help, resources and emotional assistance from a mental health professional.
As a solution I approached the college counsellors of both the branches and the PESU Operations Management to convince and build a simple and informative website
The site was provided it to the media management in the same form it is in this repository, to be unified with the PES websites (similiar UX).
The website was succesfully hosted and will run indefinitely. The base resources are the contents of this repository with no credits taken (and hopefully none in the future) as the purpose of this site is to ensure that it belongs to everyone and maximum student contributions are directed to this open source resource. 

The sole reason for publishing these base resources is to invite an opportunity to innovate on this sensitive subject of mental health in a large student base, and can also be used to contribute by approaching the respective authorities to propose changes to the existing website, or to bring it to life in another form that technology accomodates at any point in this hopeful future. 

Contents of the website:
## Counselors
PES Counselor details and location on campus is specified with their email ids and contact information.
## Blog
Blogs from PES Counselors which can answer and suggest valuable tips to common issues.
## Helpline
Helplines to be used by students when there is a necessity to talk to professionals who can assist in situations where there is a necessity for somebody to immediately talk to.
