			Many students and parents feel uneasy during exams. Students go through tremendous pressure to get good marks or grades, which helps them to get into good higher education or placement opportunities. 
			<br>
			Whatever the reasons or issues, the reality is that exams cause distress and anxiety among some students. 
			<br>
			Here are some tips for students and parents:
			
			<br>
			<ol class="list-ord">
			<li>Relax, You are not in a battleground!
			</li>
			<p>Many parents tell their wards that exams are like a battle ground and they need to study hard, do them well and win. Their intention may be positive; to make students serious and committed to studies.<br>No exams are final like a battle ground; they are just a way of evaluating students’ academic performance. It is always possible to improve scores, given the right efforts and dedication.<br>
So say this: It’s O.K. I will do whatever is possible for me.
</p>
			<li>
				Never say: I will do my best!
			</li>
			<p>Here, you are digging a pit for yourself! What is best? How do you know what is best? None of us know what is best in advance. In simple terms, did Sachin Tendulkar know he is going to have the best innings in his life at Gwalior ODI? He has been considering each innings as it comes and has been doing whatever he could do!</p>
			<li>
				Anxious? What’s wrong with it?
			</li>
			<p>Many parents, teachers and peers commit this blunder:<br> ‘Don’t be anxious!’ It is not reality! Anxiety is a natural reaction to the unknown and uncertain future events. To the extent anxiety prepares your body and mind to deal with the event. If you deny it, you will harm more of yourself than when you accept it.<br>
So when you feel anxious next time, tell yourself: I am anxious now. It’s O.K. to be anxious. I will do whatever is possible for me and feel O.K. with it.
</p>
			<li>Remember one of your happy moments!
			</li>
<p>When you remember your past happy incidents during stressful times, it acts as a booster and pumps lots of positive energy in you and makes your brain work more efficiently. This in turn will enhance your confidence and performance.</p>
